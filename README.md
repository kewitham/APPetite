We are going to create an app that utilizes the Spoontacular API, Spotify API, and the HomeCook API to create a recipe search experience encompassing several aspects of the cooking and eating process.  Our start screen will ask users for parameters our app will use to cultivate the ideal recipe and music selection for their needs.  The parameters will include ethnic food mood, nutrition, and meal (i.e. breakfast, lunch, dinner), and will be displayed through drop-down menus, or radio buttons (JS).  We are also considering including time allotted and main ingredient as additional parameters but these are wish-list items to be revisited later.  The user will choose from menu options we provide.
The Spoontacular API will give us the capability to retrieve six recipe choices that account for the ethnic food the user prefers, how nutritious the user wants the recipe to be, and which meal the user chooses.  These choices will appear on the next screen with a picture of the finished dish, that when selected, will display the recipe.  Below the recipe choices, the Spoontacular API will generate a map of the nearest location to get the ingredients for the recipes, the HomeCook API will display local farmersâ€™ market options, and the Spotify API will generate a playlist that matches the ethnicity mood chosen by the user (i.e. If the user chooses Spanish food, a flamenco music playlist might appear.)
The user will then choose from the provided food pictures and names, and click to reveal the recipe itself, remaining on the same screen.
We believe that this app will provide users ease in selecting a recipe and getting the ingredients to make the recipe while tailoring their experience to their specific requirements.  Cooking is not just about eating, but about calibrating process, mood, and convenience to the specific user.  Our app will accomplish this.
